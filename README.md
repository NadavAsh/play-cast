## About
PlayCast is a real-time gaming web application developed by Nick Clawson, Nedav Ashkenazi, and Elliot Keder during the University of Washington's DubHacks 2014 hackathon. Some features are currently not tested or still under development.

## How to play
To begin gaming, open up a browser on your device of choice and navigate to "www.play-cast.appspot.com". You will be presented with two options: "Host" or "Join".

Choose a game. If the game is multiplayer, you will be presented with an "invalid number of players" page and a host code. This host code is how other players can connect to your hosted game.

Send your host code to your friends and tell them to select "Join" from the home page and enter your host code.

Once your friends have entered your host code and the required number of players for the game has been reached, the game will automatically begin. You are now playing a real-time game together!
